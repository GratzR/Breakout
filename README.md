# Breakout
### This is a simple version of the classic game.

## Get started

### Just clone the repo, build with Unity Hub and you are good to go.
````git clone https://github.com/GratzR/Breakout.git````

## Gameplay

### You can move the bar using "a" & "d" or the right and left arrow keys.

### To shoot a new ball hit the space key.

### The blocks have different Tiers indicated by their color. The higher blocks grant more points but also need more hits to be destroyed. Each time a block is hit, his color changes to indicate the remaining lives of the block.

### Some blocks include random PowerUps, those are indicated by a small black frame. Possible Powerups are:
* Enlarge: The bar becomes bigger for a short time.
* Extraball: You get an extra ball to your inventory.
* Shrink (debuff): The bar becomes smaller for a short time.
* Multiball: An additional ball is spawned at the position of the bar.

### You win when all blocks are destroyed.

### You loose when there are no balls left.

## Have fun!
